# My1s-PPP-in-PHP
a PHP Library for Perfect paper Passwords ( https://www.grc.com/ppp )

This class uses the biginteger library from http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/math/intro.html
as well as the template Files from https://www.grc.com/ppp/pppexe.htm

the ppp.php file (The PPP Implementation) is something I wrote myself by using the algorithm documented under https://www.grc.com/ppp/algorithm.htm

Therefore the ppp.php file is Subject to [My1's Open-Source License](https://github.com/My1/My1-OSL/blob/master/My1-OSL.md)
